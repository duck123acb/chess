/*
I played this short game to come up with this list https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/118012214443?tab=analysis&move=57
things to add to evaluation:
- prevent checkmatreâˆš
- mate the opponent
- added bonus for the bishop pair
- passed pawn + protected passed pawn bonus
- piece activity (like rooks on the 7th/2nd, octopus knights, sniper bishops)
- penalty for split pawns
- king safety
